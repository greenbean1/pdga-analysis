# PDGA Analysis
This is a data analysis project exploring PDGA player information

## Next Goal: Get lots of player info (hella JSON)
1. Use API query's limit, offset, division_code, country parameters
2. Get 200 players with each query, offset by 1 then continue
3. How to save these 200 players? Append to a dataframe?

## Project Milestones
~~1. Pull down JSON of Eagle McMahon via Requests Library~~

~~2. Save sessid & session_name into txt file so do not need to hit API for login every time~~

~~3. Save Eagle McMahon's JSON into a CSV~~

4. Pull down JSON of all MPO, US players
5. Save this JSON into a CSV & put into Pandas
6. Get state population data
7. Create dataframe with state, number of players rated 1000+
8. Create heat map data viz (Notebook? Seaborn/Plotly/Dash/etc)

## Things I Learned (or at least started learning)
1. [HTTP Status Codes](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)
2. [Requests Library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
3. [Working with JSON](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-json-to-csv-in-python/)
